# Picade Sketch

This is the default firmware for the Picade;

* Maps each of the 10 main input buttons to key presses
* Maps the 4 joystick directions to Up, Down, Left and Right keys
* Uses the volume up/down to control the Amp volume

# Custom Keybinding

You can customise your key bindings to your preference, or to use multiple Picade boards together for a larger arcade cabinet project or multiplayer.

To create a custom keybinding you should only need to change the inputs mapping at the top of the Sketch.

A list of modifier key constants can be found here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyboardModifiers

Other keys can be represented as a single character, like space `' '` or x `'x'`.
