# Picade Sketch

This is the 2.x firmware for the Picade;

* Fully user configurable keybindings over Serial
* Two soft Alt states for bonus keys
* Keyboard emulation
* Gamepad emulation with 3 axis and 16 buttons
* Serial volume control

You can find the 1.x firmware which ships on all Picade PCBs here: https://github.com/pimoroni/Picade-Sketch/tree/v1.x

## Custom Keybinding

You can use either PuTTY, Arduino Serial Monitor or the supplied Python library to set and save custom key configurations to your Picade PCB. These are stored in EEPROM and preserved during power up.
